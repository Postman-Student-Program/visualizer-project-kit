# Postman Visualizer Project Kit

Data is as powerful as it is understandable. This kit will help you build a hosted project that makes sense of data from APIs with the help of Postmanâ€™s [visualizer](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/visualizer/) feature

Create a free Postman account [here](https://www.postman.com/) and [sign up as a Postman Student Expert]() if you haven't already!

## 1. Find data via an API

First you'll need data to visualize! What story are you trying to tell? Once you can answer that, there are several ways to find APIs that give you related data.

### Postman API Network

### Look for government APIs

### Search via a search engine

### Host your own data!

Have data you want to share with the world? You've got options!

- Build your own custom API
- Use [Postman mock servers](https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/) to "fake" an API to serve your data
- Host a JSON file for free on websites like [GitHub](https://github.com/) and access it via a `GET` request to the hosted file URL. Check out these [public JSON datasets](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets) for inspiration!

## 2. Decide how you want to visualize the data

**TODO: Link to example visualizations and viz libraries (d3js, chartjs, etc)**

## 3. Prototype your visualization in Postman!

**TODO: Add visualizer resources + video**

## 3. Add your visualization to your project

Fork a starter template of your choice and follow the instructions in the comments and README.md to display a production version of your visualization

- [Vanilla HTML/JS/CSS starter template](https://replit.com/@ClaireFroelich/Postman-x-Lehman-Hack-JavaScript-Project-Template#index.html)
- React starter template
- Python Flask starter template

## Examples
